								# You can also call another command to get the
								# IPv4 if you're a very advanced user ;)

								# normal (eg: your ISP has Large Scale NAT and

# Routes

								# over the 6rd tunnel yes/no

# Behaviour of the script

								# It will print out the commands on stdout.
								# And some more debug as well.
								
glob_download_tool="wget"		# "curl" is the other possibility. "wget" is default.
