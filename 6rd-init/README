0. WHAT IS THIS ?

	This software is an init script. It will configure a 6rd tunnel on a 
	Linux-based router.
	
1. WHAT IS REQUIRED ?

	- Linux >= 2.6.33 (uname -r)
	- iproute2 >= 2.6.33 (debian package "iproute")
	- bash >= 3 (bash --version)
	- cat & cut, but they are almost default features on linux.
	- wget or curl. Unless you have manually static public v4 configured.

2. WHERE IS IT KNOWN TO BE WORKING ?

	- Debian, with correct linux kernel & iproute2 (see 1.)
	- Ubuntu, with correct linux kernel & iproute2 (see 1.)

3. WHERE IS IT EXPECTED TO BE WORKING ?

	- Any linux-based distribution that fulfills requirement in 1.
	- Including OpenWRT if you install a correct kernel and iproute2.
	
4. WHERE WILL THIS _NOT_ WORK ?
	
	- *BSD
	- Windows *
	- MacOS *
	- Android * (could be working maybe later depending on their dev)
	- iPhone *
	- Other non-linux stuff
	
5. INSTALLATION ?

	- cp 6rd /etc/init.d/6rd
	- chmod 755 /etc/init.d/6rd
	- cp etc-default-6rd /etc/default/6rd
	
--- and : EDIT /etc/default/6rd !

	as root !
	
6. USAGE ?

	Well it's a init script so it will be started on startup, but you can :
	- /etc/init.d/6rd start/restart/stop
	
	as root !

7. AND RADVD ?

	The script is not configuring radvd, so you need to configure it separately.
	However, it will reload radvd after finishing the v6 config in order to force
	new RAs. You can configure for each lan iface the prefix ::/64, and radvd
	will automatically take the prefix configured on the interface.
